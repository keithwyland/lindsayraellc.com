    Therapeutic massage treatment is customized to the client’s needs to help restore function to injured "soft tissues" (muscles, tendons, and ligaments). Performed on the table, this therapy may involve the use of various types of massage with a lubricant (lotion, crème, gel, or oil) and modest draping.  Goals will be discussed prior to beginning the session, and time will be planned appropriately.

<h2>Swedish Restorative Massage</h2> 
<a href="#" class="button button--small">Schedule Restorative Massage</a>
<p>
    Swedish massage therapy is the modality that comes to mind when most people think about traditional massage. One of the primary goals of the Swedish massage technique is to deeply relax the entire body. Swedish massage is also exceptionally beneficial for improving circulation and mobility while easing muscular and mental tension.

    Pre- & Post-natal Massage
</h2>

<p>
    Pre- and post-natal massage shares many of the goals of regular massage — to relax tense muscles, ease sore spots, improve circulation and mobility, and just make you feel good – but it is specifically tailored to the unique needs of pregnant women or new moms and their changing bodies.  Massage is performed in a side-lying position utilizing a body support system.
